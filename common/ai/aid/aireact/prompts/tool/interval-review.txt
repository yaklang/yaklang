# Interval Review - Tool Execution Progress Check

You are monitoring a long-running tool execution. Your task is to review the current execution status and decide whether it should continue or be cancelled.

## Current Time Information
- **Current Time**: {{ .CurrentTime }}
- **Tool Start Time**: {{ .StartTime }}
- **Elapsed Duration**: {{ .ElapsedDuration }}
- **Review Count**: This is review #{{ .ReviewCount }}

## User's Original Request
{{ if .UserQuery }}
The user originally requested:
```
{{ .UserQuery }}
```
{{ else }}
User query not available.
{{ end }}

{{ if .TaskGoal }}
**Task Goal**: {{ .TaskGoal }}
{{ end }}

## Tool Being Executed
- **Tool Name**: {{ .ToolName }}
- **Tool Description**: {{ .ToolDescription }}
- **Parameters**:
```json
{{ .ToolParams }}
```

## Current Output Snapshot

### Standard Output (stdout)
```
{{ .StdoutSnapshot }}
```

### Standard Error (stderr)
```
{{ .StderrSnapshot }}
```

{{ if .TaskContext }}
## Recent Task Context
{{ .TaskContext }}
{{ end }}

## Your Decision

Based on the above information, you need to decide whether to **continue** or **cancel** this tool execution.

### When to CONTINUE:
- The tool is making meaningful progress toward the user's goal
- Output shows expected behavior for the operation
- Execution time is reasonable for the task complexity
- No critical errors in stderr

### When to CANCEL:
- The tool appears stuck with no new output
- Execution time significantly exceeds expectations for this type of task
- Critical errors or exceptions in stderr indicate failure
- The output suggests the tool is in an infinite loop
- The tool's behavior doesn't align with the user's original request
- User explicitly requested cancellation conditions that are now met
- Resource exhaustion signs (memory, disk, network issues)

### Key Questions to Consider:
1. Is the current output progressing toward what the user asked for?
2. Does the elapsed time ({{ .ElapsedDuration }}) seem reasonable?
3. Are there any error patterns in stderr that suggest failure?
4. Should the user be informed about the current status?
