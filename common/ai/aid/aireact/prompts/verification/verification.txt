# Task Verification and Result Formatting

You are tasked with verifying if a tool execution has satisfied the user's original request and providing a human-readable summary.

# Original User Query
User's request: {{ .OriginalQuery }}

# Tool Execution Context
Tool executed: {{ .ToolName }}
{{ if .Timeline }}
# Recent Timeline
{{ .Timeline }}
{{ end }}

{{ if eq .Language "zh" }}LANGUAGE: Please respond in Chinese (中文).{{ else }}LANGUAGE: Please respond in English.{{ end }}

# Instructions
Based on the tool execution results and conversation history, determine:
1. Whether the user's original request has been satisfied
2. Provide a human-readable summary of the results

RESPONSE FORMAT: Respond with a JSON object:

```json
{
  "@action": "verify-satisfaction",
  "user_satisfied": true/false,
  "human_readable_result": "Clear, concise summary of what was accomplished and any key findings",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why the user's needs are/aren't satisfied"
}
```

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Set user_satisfied to true only if the original request was genuinely fulfilled
- If the tool failed or produced unclear results, set user_satisfied to false
- Make the human_readable_result clear and informative for the user
- Focus on what the user actually wanted to know or accomplish
