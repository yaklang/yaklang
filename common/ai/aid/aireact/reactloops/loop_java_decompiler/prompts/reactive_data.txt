- Fixed Files: {{.FixedFiles}}

## Guidelines for Next Action

1. If there are feedback messages, address them first
2. If working on a file with issues, focus on fixing them
3. If no current file, list files or check for issues
4. Always verify fixes before moving to next file
5. Use `compare_with_backup` to verify changes against original .bak files
6. Complete the task only when all issues are resolved

## Backup System Reminder

- **All decompiled files have .bak backups** (e.g., MyClass.java.bak = original, MyClass.java = modified)
- Use `compare_with_backup` action to verify changes and ensure nothing was lost
- This helps track what modifications were made and verify correctness
